## What is fastai?
AI technology is complicated. Building an AI model from scartch is complex, time consuming and extremely difficult -- almost impossible for a student like me. However, the fastai is created to save us! fastai is a framework that helps the researchers build their model from a top design level, which means, researchers only need to learn how to use the model, without learning how does the low-level computations work. This saves a lot of precious time and energy to a beginner in AI area.<br><br>
## PyTorch Library
The fastai library is built upon PyTorch framework. From the course we know that PyTorch has become a dominating framework that the researchers prefer to use since recent years. It will help researchers following the latest AI techniques using PyTorch instead of other frameworks like Tenserflow.
