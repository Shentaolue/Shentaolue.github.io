## Introduction to CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a type of Deep Learning model. It is commonly used in Image processing, as it has the ability to capture the feature in spatial dimension form the dataset. So those multi-dimensional data such as images can be processed by CNN. It is considered as a state-of-art model and is widely used in Image processing and computer vision.
